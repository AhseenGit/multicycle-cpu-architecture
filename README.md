# multicycle-cpu-architecture
This project implements a multicycle RISC processor architecture using VHDL. It was developed as part of the *Advanced CPU Architecture and Hardware Accelerators Lab* course, focusing on digital system design, datapath/control separation, and instruction-level execution over multiple clock cycles.
